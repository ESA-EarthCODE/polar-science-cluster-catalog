# Catalog configuration

Catalog configuration point for Antarctica InSync on ESA-EarthCODE.

Antarctica InSync is a global effort to synchronise research across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, connecting ice, ocean, climate, and life to protect this vital region. [See website](https://www.antarctica-insync.org/)

As part of the initiative, and to facilitate easier analysis of and access to scientific Antarctica data, several datasets are combined into zarr stores, reprojected to a common 100x100m grid in the EPSG:3031 Antarctic Polar Stereographic projection and converted to COG for rendering in the eodash.

Catalog is available under:

Using STAC browser, e.g.:
